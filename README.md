# RSS to ICS

## Intro

Python script written in [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) to generate iCalendar (ICS) from Atom/RSS feeds.
This should work as a serverless function.

Tested upon [my blog (Atom) feed](https://blog.vinfall.com/index.xml) and several RSS feeds generated by [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub).

## Usage

Let's say the instance is running at `rss2ics.vercel.app`,
the RSS feed is `example.com/feed`,
you can generate ics via `rss2ics.vercel.app/?url=example.com/feed`.

## Todo

- [ ] Use `feed.title` for ICS filename (not sure why it's `None`...)
